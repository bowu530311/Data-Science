Average life expectancy for human being has increased drastically in the last fifty years. And one of the key driving factors is rapidly developed technologes that are widely applied in health related field. With more advanced detection methods, most of terminal diseases can now be discovered much earlier which give patients higher chance of living. However, even with all the latest technologies, surgery remains one of the best/only options in many circumstances (i.e. Steve Jobs probably could have a higher chance of living if he chose to undergo surgical path in the first instance). In 2004, WHO has estimated that 234 million operations were performed every year (*reference 1*)  and 7 million people suffers complication after (at least one million death). Therefore, complication is one of the key risks that surgical patients are facing. I hope by analysing this datasets, it can provide some insights to patients and doctors in estimating risks of complication and thus help patients and medical professionals getting better prepared. 
  
Dataset I am using for this project is from Kaggle (*reference 2*) that containes information of more than 14,000 surgical operations. It has got various kinds of data such as personal details of patients i.e. age, gender, race, and some health-related data such as bmi, different types of baseline illness as well as date and duration of surgeries and etc. The dataset contains ~14600 cases with 24 features. For this assignment, I am using this data try to solve a supervised classification problem: whether a patient will face complications after surgery based on the given information.
